## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) which converts to RGB hex value #3399FF, evoking a sense of trust and efficiency suitable for a support environment.
- Background color: Light scheme, background with HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which converts to RGB hex value #F0F5FF, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) which converts to RGB hex value #33CCCC, offers a contrasting but harmonious highlight for key interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif provides a neutral, machined look, good for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent ticket statuses and actions within the dashboard. For example, an open box for 'Open' and a checkmark for 'Closed'.
- Use a tiled, grid-based layout. Prominently display main stats at the top (e.g. number of open tickets), and ticket list below.
- Subtle transitions on ticket status updates.
